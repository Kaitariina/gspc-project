## Game Server Programming Course â€“ Final Project 

![Illustration of cards](https://github.com/Kaitariina/gspc-project/blob/master/RM_Resources/illustration_cards_kk.png?&s "Illustration of cards")

The goal of this project was to create a **backend system** that could potentially be used in \
a **digital collectible card game**. A game from this genre would typically offer nice amount \
of diverse data to be stored and multiple interesting options for queries.

We used mongoDB to store the data & Postman to test and simulate the features.
